One of the major hurdles that online shoppers face is the
inability to test the product at the time of purchase. Also,
online, it is difficult to estimate the size of the products, and
decide whether or not it will vibe with the style and body
shape of the purchaser so one can end up making a bad
purchase. Devise a solution to the above problem ensuring
the liberty of the shoppers to choose from the vast
collection of items, minimising product returns and helping
shoppers find the apparel that fit, turning moments of
hesitation in online apparel shopping into confidence &
purchase.

Approach - 

Acknowledging diversity and providing
what “they” as shoppers want through
recommending what suits best for them.
By determining the body shapes and
what style flatters and compliments a
particular body type,users get
recommendations accordingly. Majorly,
these recommendations are derived from
the past shopping experiences and cart/
wishlist additions of users of a particular
body type. This way, shoppers united by
similar body types and shapes act as
shopping guides to other fellow shoppers.

Body-shape calculator

One promising idea for
determining the type of
body shape is to use
unsupervised learning
algorithms to discover the
“natural” grouping(s) of a
set of body
measurements.

Collaborative filtering

User-based collaborative
filtering algorithms embedded
in the recommendation
systems would show the
products with the better
reviews from customers with
similar body shapes(i.e
belonging to the same
clusters).
